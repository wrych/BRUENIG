# Project Title

BRUENIG | EIGER WebClient

BRUENIG is an EIGER browser client that allows to configure and control DECTRIS EIGER detectors. 

## Getting Started

To run BRUENIG, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser. Please note that currently a module adding CORS headers to server responses is required.  

```
git clone https://github.com/wrych/BRUENIG.git
cd bruenig
firefox index.html
```

### Prerequisites

A broswer (e.g. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)) and CORS plugin (e.g. [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/)) compatible with the browser is required to run BRUENIG


### Installing

There is no installation required.

## Running the tests

This project, sadly, was written without tests.

## Deployment

There is no automated way of generating a production (.min) version of the JavaScript files.
